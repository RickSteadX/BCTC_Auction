## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Bot not responding to commands**
   - Ensure bot has proper permissions
   - Check if commands are synced (restart bot)
   - Verify bot token is correct

2. **Database errors**  
   - Ensure write permissions in bot directory
   - Check if `auctions.db` is corrupted (delete to reset)

3. **Missing notifications**
   - Set `NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_ID` in `.env`
   - Ensure bot has permissions in notification channel

### Logs

## Development Notes

This bot uses modern Discord.py features including:
- Application commands (slash commands)
- Views and UI components  
- Modal forms
- Select menus
- Interactive buttons
- Embed builders

The architecture is modular with clear separation between:
- Bot startup and configuration (`main.py`, `config.py`)
- Event handling and background tasks (`bot_events.py`)
- Core bot functionality (`bot.py`)
- Notification system (`notification_service.py`)
- Data management (`auction_manager.py`)  
- User interface (`auction_cog.py`)
